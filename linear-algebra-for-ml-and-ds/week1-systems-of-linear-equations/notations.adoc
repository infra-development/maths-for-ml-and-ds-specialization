| `A`, `B`, `C`
| Capital letters represent _matrices_

| `u`, `v`, `w`
| Lowercase letters represent _vectors_

| `A` of size stem:[m × n] or stem:[(m × n)]
| Matrix `A` has `m` rows and `n` columns

| stem:[A^T]
| Transpose of matrix `A`

| stem:[v^T]
| Transpose of vector `v`

| stem:[A^{-1}]
| Inverse of matrix `A`

| stem:[\det(A)]
| Determinant of matrix `A`

| stem:[AB]
| Matrix multiplication of matrices `A` and `B`

| stem:[u ⋅ v], stem:[\langle u, v \rangle]
| Dot product of vectors `u` and `v`

| stem:[\mathbb{R}]
| The set of real numbers (e.g. `0`, `-0.642`, `2`, `3.456`)

| stem:[\mathbb{R}^2]
| Set of 2-dimensional vectors +
 stem:[v = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}]

| stem:[\mathbb{R}^n]

| L1-norm of a vector

| stem:[\|v\|_2;\ \|v\|;\ ]
